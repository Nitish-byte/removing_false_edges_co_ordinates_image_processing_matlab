# removing_false_edges_co_ordinates_image_processing_matlab
This code filters the co-ordinates of the false edges due to the noise and other factors

Sample:
pic_0 is the original image
sq_3_3_edges are its edges in rgb
sq_3_3 is the plot of its edges with noise
sq_3_3_algo plot of edges after using this function
